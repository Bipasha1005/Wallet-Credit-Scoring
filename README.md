# Wallet Credit Scoring using Aave V2 Transactions

## üåü Objective
Assign a credit score between **0 and 1000** to wallets based on their historical behavior on the **Aave V2 DeFi protocol**, using transaction-level data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview of the Solution
This solution analyzes raw transaction logs from Aave V2, groups them by wallet, extracts behavioral and financial features, and then scores each wallet using normalized feature values.

---

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Load JSON**: Flat transaction records are loaded from `user_transactions.json`.
2. **Group by Wallet**: Transactions are grouped by `userWallet`.
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Transaction counts and amounts for key actions.
   - Time gap between actions.
   - Duration of activity (active days).
   - Ratios: repay/borrow, redeem/deposit.
4. **Scoring Logic**:
   - Features are normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Final credit score = mean of normalized features √ó 1000.
5. **Save Output**: Results saved to `wallet_scores.csv`.
